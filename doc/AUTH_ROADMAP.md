## Dependencies and Prerequisites

### Phase 1 Dependencies

## Risk Assessment and Mitigation

### Phase 1 Risks
**Risk**: Authentication configuration errors
**Mitigation**: Parallel deployment, keep backup configs

**Risk**: Service disruption during migration
**Mitigation**: Deploy during maintenance window, quick rollback plan

### Phase 2 Risks
**Risk**: User acceptance of new authentication
**Mitigation**: Clear communication, training materials

**Risk**: Role permission configuration errors
**Mitigation**: Start with minimal permissions, expand carefully

### Phase 3 Risks
**Risk**: Database migration data loss
**Mitigation**: Full backup before migration, test environment first

**Risk**: OIDC integration complexity
**Mitigation**: Test with simple client first, document process

### Phase 4 Risks
**Risk**: External SSO provider issues
**Mitigation**: Multiple provider options, fallback to local auth

**Risk**: Performance impact of advanced features
**Mitigation**: Performance monitoring, feature toggles
