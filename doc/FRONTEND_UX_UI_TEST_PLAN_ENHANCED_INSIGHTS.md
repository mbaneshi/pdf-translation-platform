## Summary
The enhanced UX/UI + test plan is comprehensive and aligns with our backend capabilities and product goals. Below are focused insights to sharpen execution, reduce flakiness, and ensure measurable outcomes.

## What’s Strong
- Clear mapping from capabilities → UI affordances (review, progress, export).
- Emphasis on reliability: polling, error states, and cost/tokens surfaced to users.
- Broad test strategy across unit, component, and integration layers.

## Suggestions & Refinements

- Testing Infrastructure
  - Adopt MSW as the default test network layer across suites (including current API tests) to avoid brittle fetch mocks.
  - Standardize fake timers and polling intervals. Expose polling interval via env or prop to shorten tests.
  - Introduce a shared test utils module for render wrappers (ThemeProvider, MSW handlers, Router mocks).

- Accessibility & RTL
  - Add a single source for RTL sample strings (Persian corpus) and use it across tests to validate shaping/punctuation.
  - Include keyboard navigation tests for critical flows (upload, review approve, export); verify focus order and aria-live regions for toasts/status.

- Visual Confidence (Optional)
  - Integrate Storybook and percy/Chromatic for visual regression on Review Panel and Progress Header.
  - Keep this optional to avoid slowing CI; run on PR labels or nightly.

- Performance & UX Guardrails
  - Virtualize long lists; add tests asserting items render only when visible (using IntersectionObserver mocks).
  - Rate-limit polling and apply backoff on 429/5xx; add tests to verify backoff increments and UI messaging.

- Error Taxonomy
  - Normalize API errors into a small set (network, validation, auth, server, rate-limit). Centralize mapping in api client; snapshot test banners.

- Export/Download Robustness
  - Add tests for file name sanitization, blob creation fallback, and large content handling (streamed or chunked text).

## Deliverables Checklist
- MSW setup: global server, per-suite handlers, fixtures for upload/progress/export.
- Test utilities: providers wrapper (Theme, Router), fake timers helpers.
- Review Panel + tests: diff toggle, approve action, error handling.
- Progress Header + tests: ETA calculation, tokens/cost aggregation, polling pause/resume.
- A11y + RTL tests: roles, keyboard, RTL snapshots.
- Optional: Storybook stories for key components; visual regression on demand.

## Success Metrics
- All frontend suites green; coverage ≥80%.
- No flaky tests in two consecutive CI runs (same commit); track via CI retries metric.
- Time-to-green for PRs remains <5 minutes for frontend jobs.

## Risks & Mitigations
- Flaky network-dependent tests → MSW + deterministic timers.
- Visual flakiness → optional visual regression, not gating CI initially.
- Over-mocking state → retain a thin layer of integration tests using MSW to assert component wiring end-to-end.
